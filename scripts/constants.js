 *   here; it lives in memory on every client (see `getSources` in `helpers.js`).
 * - `MENU`: the light-sources configuration menu.
 * - `COMPAT_MENU`: the system-compatibility configuration menu.
 * - `TRANSFER_MENU`: the import/export menu, which copies a world's light sources and
 *   compatibility settings to another world through a JSON file.
 * - `ITEM_TYPES` / `ACTOR_TYPES`: which of the detected system's document
 *   types this module treats as light-source items / light-bearing actors.
 * - `QUANTITY_PATH`: dotted path (from the item root) to an item's quantity.
 * - `CHARGES_PATH`: dotted path (from the item root) to how many charges an item
 *   has left.
 * - `CHARGES_SPENT_PATH`: optional dotted path to the charges an item has used, for
 *   a system that counts up; when set, lighting writes here instead.
 * - `ALLOW_FREE_FOR_ALL_DROP`: whether "free for all" lights may be dropped on
 *   the ground (see `getAllowFreeForAllDrop` in `helpers.js`).
 * - `RESTRICT_PLAYER_CONTROL`: whether only the GM may activate, deactivate,
 *   drop or pick up a light source from the Token HUD (see
 *   `getRestrictPlayerControl` in `helpers.js`).
 * - `ANNOUNCE_LIT`: whether lighting a source posts a chat message (see

 *   Item that is burning, or null when no item is (a copy was spent, or a
 *   free-for-all source has none); older effects lack it and count as null.

 *   the GM placed by hand) and carries what is needed to light it again on a token
 *   ({sourceId, patternId, patternName, itemName, actorUuid, itemId, mode,
 *   expiresAtWorld, expiresAtReal, managedBy}). Without it a dropped light is
 *   indistinguishable from scenery. `itemId` is the Item the flame burned on, as on

 *   Older lights lack it and count as null. `managedBy` names the module that placed
 *   it through the API and hands it back itself; absent for a light dropped from the
 *   Token HUD.
 * - `INTERACTIVE`: set on an AmbientLight the players may switch on and off from the
 *   map. The GM sets it per light in the native light config; lights dropped by a
 *   player get it automatically. A light another module manages keeps the flag but
 *   gets no control while that module is active (see `isManagedElsewhere`).
