 * how to charge. The system charges it, then calls this; pair it with `hudHidden`
 * so the Token HUD cannot be used to skip the charge.

 * creation on an Actor the current user does not own, so from a player's client this

 * Ownership is checked up front and reported as `false` rather than left to throw.
 * There is deliberately no relay that would let one player light another's actor.
 *

 * Token HUD palette, and this path is not the palette: whatever charged the light
 * has already run, and a caller can only ever reach an actor it already owns.
 * @param {Actor} actor The actor to light. Must be owned by the current user.
 * @param {string} id The source's id: its uuid when it has one. A source the GM added
 *   by name has no uuid, and its id is the one `getActive` reports.
 * @param {object} [options={}]
